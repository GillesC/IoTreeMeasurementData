# IoTreeMeasurementData

This repository contains the data collected in the [IoTree project](https://www.dramco.be/projects/iotree/).

The reduced datasets consist of the following variables:
*	Unieke ID of the sensor: `dev_id`
*	Accelerometer X direction: `payload_fields_accelerometer_3_x`
*	Accelerometer Y direction: `payload_fields_accelerometer_3_y` 
*	Accelerometer Z direction: `payload_fields_accelerometer_3_z` 
*	Temperature outdoor: `payload_fields_temperature_2`
*	Temperature trunk: `payload_fields_temperature_1`
*	Time: `metadata_gateways_0_timestamp`
